## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

##### Splitting up frontend and backend
Explanation:
- By segregating tasks into distinct frontend and backend domains, the team can concentrate on their unique strengths and expertise. This approach fosters heightened efficiency and productivity, while also paving the way for future scalability and adaptability of each individual component. The clear separation of responsibilities fosters a harmonious workflow, ultimately resulting in the seamless integration of the final product.

Artifact:
- Task breakdown on Jira
##### Having coding sessions together
Explanation:
- Keeping coding sessions together offers benefits like improved communication, collaboration, and understanding among team members. It facilitates swift knowledge sharing, efficient code reviews, and early detection of conflicts or dependencies. This approach reduces integration challenges and fosters a sense of shared ownership, leading to increased creativity and innovation. Ultimately, it enhances code quality, productivity, and the overall success of the project.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

##### Overlooking Team Skillsets:
- We made the mistake of overlooking the specific skillsets and expertise of individual team members when assigning tasks. As a result, some team members were assigned to tasks outside their core competencies, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address this, we plan to conduct a thorough skills assessment and consider individual strengths when distributing responsibilities

##### Insufficient Risk Management

- We initially neglected to conduct a thorough risk assessment, leaving us unprepared for potential setbacks and obstacles. This oversight impacted the team's ability to proactively address challenges as they arose, and led to delay in finishing tasks according to expected timeline.

#### Planned changes

##### Skill-Based Task Assignment:

- To address overlooking team skillsets, we'll conduct comprehensive skills assessments and consider individual strengths when assigning tasks. This ensures team members work in their areas of expertise, leading to higher efficiency and better outcomes.
##### Enhanced Risk Management Protocol

- To tackle insufficient risk management, we'll conduct thorough risk assessments throughout the project. Proactive identification of setbacks and obstacles allows us to develop contingency plans and allocate resources accordingly

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

##### Introducing calendar UI

- We have successfully introduced a basic calendar UI for our calendar component, which allows viewing and selecting events during a week.

##### Chat page front end

- We have refactored the chat page front end from making use of the chat engine. It allows easier connection to our backend and database.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- Refining calling and messaging functionalities was not completed as we encountered multiple challenges during the sprint that had delayed our progress. We also decided to prioritize on other tasks that served as the backbone for coming tasks

## Meeting Highlights
Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

#### Continue having coding sessions together:  

- Having coding sessions together significantly boosted our productivity and improved communication. It also shortens the time to discover bugs. We are planning on continuing having coding sessions together next sprint.

#### Schedule for each small task:

- A schedule provides a clear timeline for completing each small task, ensuring that team members understand their priorities and can focus on their immediate responsibilities. With specific deadlines for individual tasks, team members can allocate their time more effectively, minimizing procrastination and optimizing productivity.
