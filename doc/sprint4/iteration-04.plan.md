# CURRENT

## Iteration 04

* Start date: Tuesday, July 25, 2023
* End date: Friday, August 4, 2023 

## Process

We pretty much have the process figured out for this sprint, since thereâ€™s been 3 sprints already.

#### Changes from previous iteration

* Setting deadlines for each small task. Since we have many tasks to complete the sprint, with many of them being dependent on others being complete, we made a schedule for when each task should be completed so that the next task could be worked on. This change will be considered successful if we complete all of our tasks before the end of the sprint.

We are happy with everything else and will not be making any other changes.
